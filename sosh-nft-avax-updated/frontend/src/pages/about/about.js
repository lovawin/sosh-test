          Purchaser’s instructions set out in section 4 of this agreement.{" "}
          <br />
          4)<b> Pricing and Payment</b>.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              By entering into a Purchaser/Creator Transaction, the Purchaser
              shall pay the Purchaser Payment applicable to the relevant
              Purchaser/Creator Transaction according to the pricing published
              on the relevant NFT marketplace plus any applicable Tax. In
              detail, the Creators, who are users of various social media
              platforms such as TikTok, X (Twitter), YouTube, and Instagram,
              create and upload social media content encompassing a wide range
              of topics including travel, sports, tech, lifestyle, and more.
              These Creators generate content that captivates millions of
              followers, with over 50 million individuals falling into this
              category. As part of their work, these Creators retain ownership
              of their intellectual property (<b>“IP”</b>) while granting a
              non-exclusive license for commercial use through the sale of NFTs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Specifically, Creators will be compensated by licensing their
              Content via NFT sales. Each NFT will be linked to a specific piece
              of Content, such as a YouTube video or an Instagram post. By
              holding the NFT associated with a particular piece of Content,
              Purchasers will acquire a non-exclusive license to use that
              Content for commercial purposes. This unique approach, utilizing
              NFTs for content licensing, sets our platform apart from
              traditional methods where purchasing NFTs did not confer licensing
              rights regarding the content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Moreover, the Creator will retain ownership of the IP of their
              Content. Regardless of whether the NFT holder is the Creator of
              the Relevant Content, a direct Purchaser from the Creator, or a
              subsequent Purchaser from someone other than the Creator, each
              holder will receive a license to utilize the Content for
              commercial purposes while in possession of the Relevant NFT. This
              ensures that the Creator maintains control over their IP while
              providing Purchasers with the opportunity to utilize the Content
              in a commercially viable manner.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          5) <b>Cancellations and Refunds.</b>.  For its Service, Service may
          receive certain fees. Sosh does not set, collect, or determine other
          applicable costs, fees, and expenses associated with the Content,
          including but not limited to any Creator earnings, gas, or transaction
          fees. These costs, fees, and expenses are paid directly to the
          Creator, payment processor, blockchain validator, or other third
          party, as applicable. Because these costs, fees, and expenses are not
          collected by Sosh, it cannot refund them. If you breach any of the
          provisions of these Terms, all licenses granted by OpenSea will
          terminate automatically. Sosh reserves the right, with or without
          notice and in our sole discretion, to suspend, restrict, disable,
          terminate, or delete any your account and/or your ability to access or
          use the Service (or any part of the foregoing) at any time and for any
          or no reason, and you acknowledge and agree that Sosh shall have no
          liability or obligation to you in such event and that you will not be
          entitled to a refund of any amounts that you have already paid to
          Sosh. If Sosh terminates your account or restricts your access or use
          of the Service, you retain ownership of your NFTs. You may still
          access your NFTs through public blockchains and other web3 wallets,
          platforms, and/or websites.
          <br />
          <p className="body-text">
            <b>6) Content License.</b> Once the Purchaser has made the Purchaser
            Payment for a Purchaser/Creator Transaction, the Creator hereby
            grants the Purchaser an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy,
            and display the applicable Content of that Creator to which the
            Purchaser/Creator Transaction relates (<b>“Relevant Content”</b>)
            for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Relevant
            Content, or as otherwise permitted by law (<b>“Commercial Use”</b>).
            Ownership of the NFT related to the Relevant Content (
            <b>“Relevant NFT”</b>) shall grant the Commercial Use provided for
            in this Section 6 to such Relevant NFT owner. This license is
            transferable, sublicensable, and non-exclusive, and allows the
            Purchaser Commercial Use of the Relevant Content to the extent
            permitted by law.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text">
            <b>7) Content Ownership.</b> The Purchaser participating in the
            Purchaser/Creator Transaction acknowledges that the Relevant Content
            license provided in Section 6 of this Agreement does not result in
            the Purchaser acquiring any rights in or to the Relevant Content
            (except as provided in Section 6), which rights will be retained by
            the minting Creator of the Relevant Content.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text">
            <b>8) License Termination.</b> The license granted to a Purchaser
            for the Relevant Content will terminate automatically without notice
            in the following circumstances:
            <br />
            a) if the Purchaser’s User account is suspended or terminated for
            any reason;
            <br />
            b) if the Purchaser acts in breach of the Terms of Service (whether
            with respect to the Relevant Content or at all);
            <br />
            c) if the Content is removed from the Creator’s account; or
            <br />
            d) if the Purchaser closes their Sosh User account.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text">
            <b>9) Creator and Purchaser Obligations.</b> With respect to every
            Purchaser/Creator Transaction:
            <br />
            a) The Purchaser and the Creator participating in the
            Purchaser/Creator Transaction shall comply at all times with the
            Terms of Service with respect to the Relevant Content.
            <br />
            b) The Purchaser participating in the Purchaser/Creator Transaction
            shall make the Purchaser Payment required to complete the
            Purchaser/Creator Transaction in good faith.
            <br />
            c) The Creator participating in the Purchaser/Creator Transaction
            shall transfer the Relevant NFT upon completion of the
            Purchaser/Creator Transaction. The Creator agrees that such transfer
            of the Relevant NFT to the Purchaser grants the Purchaser rights to
            Commercial Use as provided in Section 5 of this Agreement.
            <br />
            d) The Creator warrants that it possesses all necessary rights in
            and to the Relevant Content sufficient to license it to the
            Purchaser in the territory in which the Purchaser will be making
            Commercial Use of the Relevant Content and has obtained all
            permissions and consents needed to grant the license in Section 5 of
            this Agreement.
            <br />
            e) The Creator is solely responsible for creating, uploading, and
            minting the Relevant Content. The Creator provides no guarantees
            that it will continue to create and upload Content on an ongoing
            basis.
            <br />
            f) Unless there has been negligence or other breach of duty by the
            Creator, the Purchaser’s purchasing of the Relevant Content is
            entirely at the Purchaser’s own risk.
          </p>

            <br />
            e) Creator has all necessary rights, consents, and permissions to
            provide all information and Content to Purchasers with which to
            perform their Creator NFT services, and such information and Content

            a) All matters relating to the Sosh NFT Platform and this Agreement,
            and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in
            each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be
            governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of
            the State of Wyoming without giving effect to any choice or conflict

              PLEASE READ THIS “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION CAREFULLY. IT LIMITS
              THE WAYS YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM SOSH AND REQUIRES YOU TO
              ARBITRATE DISPUTES ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
            </i>
            <br />
            a) Any claim or dispute relating in any way to your use of the Sosh
            NFT Platform, or to any products or services sold or distributed by
            the Sosh NFT Platform shall be resolved by binding arbitration,
            rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small
            claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and
            federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement.
            <br />
            b) There is no jury or judge in arbitration, and court review of an
            arbitration award is limited. However, arbitrators can award on an
            individual basis the same damages and relief as a court could
            (including declaratory and injunctive relief or statutory damages),
            and must follow the terms of these Terms of Service as a court
            would.
            <br />
            c) To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter
            requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Sosh 30 N Gould
            St, Ste R, Sheridan, WY 82801. The arbitration will be conducted by
            the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules,
            including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related
            Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at{" "}

            or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration,
            and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. You may
            choose to have the arbitration conducted based on written
            submissions, telephone, or at another mutually agreed location.
            <br />
            d) We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be
            conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class,
            consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim
            proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any
            right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring
            suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual
            property rights.

            term or condition, and any failure of Sosh to assert a right or
            provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such
            right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a
            court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
            illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be
            eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining
