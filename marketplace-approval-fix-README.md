# NFT Marketplace Approval Fix

This update addresses an issue where users were experiencing "Failed to Approve" errors when attempting to list NFTs for sale on the marketplace.

## Problem Identified

The error occurred when users tried to approve the marketplace contract to handle their NFTs in cases where:

1. The marketplace contract already owned the NFT
2. The approval transaction was being attempted unnecessarily

The transaction logs showed:
```
Transaction has been reverted by the EVM:
{
  "blockHash": "0x89780093699ea144a0cd8f824025ae5afe1a909d0bb14ea01cc91f55ccad22c1",
  "blockNumber": 39459478,
  "status": false,
  ...
}
```

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a comprehensive fix that:

1. Checks if the marketplace already owns the NFT before attempting approval
2. Skips the approval process if the marketplace is already the owner
3. Adds enhanced logging to track these scenarios
4. Provides better error handling and user feedback

### Files Modified

## Testing the Fix

### Using the Diagnostic Script

Run the diagnostic script with a token ID and wallet address:

```bash
node test-marketplace-approval.js 12 0x7411e7942f4c8271d4e636429f374997fdaede17
```

The script will:
1. Check who owns the token
2. Verify if the marketplace already has approval
3. Simulate the approval process
4. Provide recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. Log in to the marketplace with a wallet that owns NFTs
2. Navigate to the profile page
3. Attempt to list an NFT for sale
4. Observe if the "Approve Marketplace" button appears appropriately
5. Complete the approval process if needed
6. Verify the NFT can be listed for sale

## Monitoring

We've added enhanced logging for marketplace operations. To check the logs:

```bash
node sosh_nft_Backend/check-marketplace-logs.js
```

Look for events with the following types:
- `APPROVAL_ATTEMPT`
- `APPROVAL_RESULT`
- `APPROVAL_SKIPPED` (new event type for when approval is skipped)
- `TRANSACTION_ERROR`

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are encountered, use the restore script:

```bash
node restore-marketplace-files.js
```

Follow the prompts to select which backup files to restore.
